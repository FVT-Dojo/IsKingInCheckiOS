#  IsKingInCheck goes iOS

- ✅ Create a button on the main screen
- ✅ Create a first test, to verify the existence of the button
- ✅ Create a chessboard component
    - Currently the chessboard is all black. Let's see if we can get it to show some color
- ✅ REFACTOR: Update the chessboard to make it possible to display pieces and set the color of a square
- ✅ Show the K and R using a mock
- ✅ REFACTOR: Remove the enum of pieces to simplify the code, and to enable the backend to invent new pieces on the fly
- ✅ REFACTOR: Move parts in the chessboard file to their own files, to adhere to MVVM and clean up the code
- 🙋‍♂️ Implement the actual API call!
    -- We created a setup to do this, but it is not working yet. Maybe this is the same problem we encountered in Android. So look in that direction, Arthur!
